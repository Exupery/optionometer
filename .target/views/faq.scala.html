    <ol>
        <li>Is Optionometer a good place to start for an inexperienced trader?
            <p>The data presented here is most useful to those already familiar with the basics of option
            trading. If you're a new trader you may want to take a look at our new trader PLACEHOLDER</p>
        </li>
        <li>Does Optionometer screen all US stocks?
            <p>Not yet, only components of the S&#38;P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are screened.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Any plans to include more strategies?
            <p>There are plans to eventually include butterflies and condors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Why is the data delayed?
            <p>At this phase (early beta) there is not yet the need to incur the costs associated
            with providing the data in real-time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Will Optionometer always be free?
            <p>Once all features have been implemented and testing has completed much of the data presently
            available will continue to be offered without a subscription.</p>
        </li>
        <li>What will be the benefit of a subscription?
            <p>That has not yet been determined, some possibilities are access to more symbols, more strategies, or
            real-time data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Is there a target date for completion?
            <p>As of Fall 2013 the plan is to have concluded beta by the end of the year.</p>
